When  Robert was seven years old, his father sold his birth home and took possession of a 70 acre farm at Mount Oliphant.<ref>[http://www.robertburns.org/encyclopedia/MountOliphant.657.shtml "Mount Oliphant"], The Burns Encyclopedia, www.robertburns.org, accessed 26 Nov 2018</ref> Robert spent his youth there in poverty and had a very  difficult childhood. All the manual labor Robert did on the farm led to health issues throughout his life as well as a stoop in his posture. 

Robert attended an "adventure" school started by his father and several neighbors.<ref name=poetry/> He went to a mathematics school in 1775 in Kirkoswald.<ref name=poetry/> Robert's early love of literature often set him at odds with his tiny part of the world, which was so focused on agriculture.<ref name=poetry/> It was only after his father's death that he felt free to pursue his love of writing.<ref name=poetry/>

Robert loved women and had children with several during his life. Robert's first child was Elizabeth Paton Burns, born in 1785, from a relationship he had with one of his mother's servants, [[Paton-792|Elizabeth Paton]].<ref>

In March 1786, his second and third children, twins, were born of a relationship with Jean Armour.  Robert signed a paper declaring his marriage to Jean, but her father destroyed the document and refused to acknowledge the venture.<ref name=poetry/> To avoid dishonor and scandal, Jean's  parents sent her to live with her uncle in Paisley. Despite her father's objections, Robert and Jean were married in 1788.<ref>Ancestry.com.

Being married did not stop Robert from pursuing other women, including but not limited to [[Campbell-2615|Margaret Campbell]]<ref>[http://www.robertburns.org/encyclopedia/CampbellHighlandMary176315186.180.shtml "Margaret Campbell (Highland Mary)"], The Burns Encyclopedia, www.robertburns.org, accessed 26 Nov 2018</ref>, [[Wikipedia:May_Cameron|May Cameron]], [[Craig-6804 |Agnes McLehose]]<ref>Wikipedia contributors, "Agnes Maclehose," Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia, [[Wikipedia:Agnes_Maclehose|Agnes Maclehose (Clarinda)]] (accessed November 26, 2018).</ref>, [[Clow-42|Jenny Clow]]<ref>Wikipedia contributors, "Jenny Clow," Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia, [[Wikipedia:Jenny_Clow|Jenny Clow]] (accessed November 26, 2018).</ref>, and

=== Poet ===
At first, Robert followed his paternal heritage in becoming a tenant farmer.<ref name=poetry>Brown, Mary Ellen, [https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/robert-burns "Robert Burns"], PoetryFoundation.org, Indiana University. Accessed 26 Nov 2018</ref> He started writing poetry, but to make sure he could stay away from the farm, worked to be an excise officer.<ref name=poetry/> He started writing poetry and songs following the death of his father.<ref name=poetry/> His first tome, "Poems, Chiefly in the Scottish Dialect", was printed in Kilmarnock in 1786 and paid for by subscriptions.<ref name=poetry/>

Robert's poetry explored the worlds of farm life, Scotland's culture, religion, and his life experiences.<ref name=poetry/> He began his writing career writing for his local audience, but started to reach out to the rest of his country and embrace his identity as a Scotsman.<ref name=poetry/>

One reason Robert was lauded as Scotland's poet, apart from so many viewing him as the Scottish "every man", was because he marked the end of an era in which the poets of the country wrote in their ancient vernacular. The shift was eminent in Robert's time, toward the use of English, as is seen in his published works being in print in both languages.<ref name=poetry/> Alternately, Robert's works mark the beginning of another era, his own poems often called "Pre-Romantic" for their sensitive focus on nature, high emotion, and backward seeking interest in legends and folk songs.<ref name=poetry/> Some of his work even included the collecting and revising of those old tunes. One of his best known works, the poem "Auld Lang Syne", is often sung at [[Wikipedia:Hogmanay|Hogmanay]], or New Year's Eve.<ref>[http://www.robertburns.org/works/236.shtml "Auld Lang Syne"] The Burns Encyclopedia, www.robertburns.org, accessed 26 Nov 2018</ref> "[http://www.robertburns.org/encyclopedia/ScotsWhaHae.21.shtml Scots Wha Hae]" served for a long time as an unofficial national anthem of Scotland. Other poems and songs of Burns that remain well known across the world today include "[http://www.robertburns.org/works/444.shtml A Red, Red Rose]", "[http://www.robertburns.org/works/496.shtml A Man's A Man for A' That]", "[http://www.robertburns.org/works/97.shtml To a Louse]","[http://www.robertburns.org/works/75.shtml To a Mouse]", "[http://www.robertburns.org/works/285.shtml The Battle of Sherramuir]","[http://www.robertburns.org/works/308.shtml Tam o' Shanter]", and "[http://www.robertburns.org/works/358.shtml Ae Fond Kiss]".

=== Legacy ===
Robert Burns died in Dumfries on July 21st, 1796, of rheumatic fever (some note it was likely endocarditis).<ref name=poetry/> He was only 37 years old.<ref name=find>Find a Grave, database and images [https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/1853/robert-burns : accessed 17 June 2022], memorial page for Robert Burns (25 Jan 1759–21 Jul 1796), {{FindAGrave|1853}}, citing St Michael's Churchyard, Dumfries, Dumfries and Galloway, Scotland ; Maintained by Find a Grave.</ref> On his deathbed, Robert spoke to his wife Jean, then to James Maclure, his attendant, telling him to "Be a good man; be virtuous; be religious. Nothing else will give you comfort when you come to be here."

Robert was buried in St. Michael's Churchyard, Dumfries, Dumfries and Galloway Scotland.<ref name=find/> In September 1815, his body was transferred to the Burns Mausoleum, which was paid for with public subscriptions. It was erected in the southeast corner of the churchyard.<ref>[http://www.undiscoveredscotland.co.uk/dumfries/burnsmausoleum/ Burns Mausoleum], undiscoveredscotland.co.uk, accessed 26 Nov 2018</ref><ref name=jean/> Jean Armour's remains were added to the mausoleum in 1834. At the same time, a cast was taken of Robert Burns's skull.<ref name=jean/>

Burns Suppers are held annually on or near Robert's birthday to pay tribute to the life, works, and spirit of the Scottish poet. The supper parties are most common in Scotland and Northern Ireland, with some celebrations in the United Kingdom and the United States as well. The gatherings may be formal or informal, but almost all include haggis and the drinking of Scotch whisky, as well as the reading of Burns's works. 

A little-known fact is that President Abraham Lincoln, who himself penned a few verses, much admired the writings of Robert Burns. He attended the 1859 "Burns  Nicht" [Night] celebration at Springfield's Concert Hall, marking the 100th anniversary of the birth of Scotland's Bard. One newspaper of the day reported that "The toasts offered on this occasion were most appropriate, and were responded to by some of the most talented men of the state, among whom were, Abraham Lincoln ..."<ref>[http://www.thelincolnlog.org/Results.aspx?type=CalendarDay&day=1859-01-25&r=L0NhbGVuZGFyWWVhci5hc3B4P3llYXI9MTg1OSZyPUwwTmhiR1Z1WkdGeUxtRnpjSGc9 "The Lincoln Log", Lincoln Sesquicentennial Commission, Tuesday, 25 Jan 1859,] citing four Illinois newspapers.
