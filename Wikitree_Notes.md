## Creating a profile:
1. Search for existing profile(s) (Also consider following when searching:
  * Variety of naming conventions/spellings
  * Uncertainty of dates (the further back in time you go, especially pre-1700)
2. Find out if there is a project that covers this area/family
  * [Pre-1700 Projects](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Category:Pre-1700_Projects)
  * [Projects[(https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Help:Projects)
  * If there is a project ask the project members, private communication or [G2G](https://www.wikitree.com/g2g/) question with project tag, if the person might already be on WikiTree
 3. Observe [Style](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Category:Styles_and_Standards) rules
  * Projects may have style rules to follow
  * Ask questions if needed
 4. Cite sources
 5. Add family - Connecting existing profiles or create new profiles

## Project lists:
  1. [Huguenot Migration](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Help:Projects#Huguenot_Migration)
     Mission & Goals:
     This Project seeks to acknowledge people who self-identified as religious Huguenots, sometimes called "French Huguenots," who lived between 1540 and 1790, spoke French, or a language associated with French, were Protestant or "Reformed" Christians, and were somehow persecuted or discriminated against so that they chose to leave their home (either within France or a mixed-language borderland such as Wallonia, Flanders, Artois, Hainaut, Franche Comte, or Alsace-Lorraine...), and find a better life abroad. We seek to add their profiles to our growing Global Family Tree or to improve those Huguenot profiles already on WikiTree. Adding or improving primary and secondary sources for such profiles is a key part of this Project's mission.
     * All duplicate profiles merged into lowest number
     * Clean up the biography, using the WikiTree Style Guide (work with the Profile Improvement Project for help)
     * Attached family should meet these goals, too and have the appropriate Sticker.
     * IF you are Profile Manager of a PPP profile with the Huguenot Template, Add the Project Account as a Manager for the profile. Coordinate with Chet Snow for e-mail address.
     * For a non-PPP profile with the Huguenot Template, Add the appropriate Sticker (see the descriptions above and "Templates" on this page) and delete the Huguenot Template / Project Box. The Huguenot Project Box will remain only on PPP profiles.

  4. [Appalachia](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Project:Appalachia) 
     Mission & Goals: 
     The primary goal of the Appalachia Project is to work collaboratively on WikiTree profiles of Appalachian people with proper sourcing, detailed biographies and appropriate categories.
     * Add (or enhance existing) Profiles, Write, Source and Connect.
     * Add Appalachian-related profiles, checking for existing profiles to avoid duplication. If any duplicate profiles exist, request merges.
     * Clean up GEDCOM residue and fix broken links. For example: The DeCoursey gedcom and the Howe(1) gedcom have a tremendous amount of work needed.
     * Write comprehensive, well-sourced biographies.
     * Add any relevant categories to Appalachian profiles.
     * Connect Profiles to the WikiTree tree.
  5. [US Southern Colonies](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Project:US_Southern_Colonies) pre-1776
     Mission & Goals:
     The goal of the US Southern Colonies Project is to work on profiles of those born or settled in the colonies of Maryland, Virginia, the Carolinas and Georgia prior to 1776. It is our aim to thoroughly research the genealogy of these profiles, cite reliable sources, write well-crafted biographies, and connect them to the global tree where possible.
