    When a profile has a tag such as [[Category:Madisonville, Louisiana]] in its text the profile will appear on the Category:Madisonville, Louisiana page. 
        For example:
        Category:Regions
          Category:North America
            Category:United States of America
              Category:Louisiana
                Category:St. Tammany Parish, Louisiana
                   Category:Madisonville, Louisiana
    Profiles can be in multiple categories. This makes them easier to find. However, a profile should never be in more than one category in the same hierarchy.
    Always select the narrowest applicable category. That is, choose the most-specific, lowest-level category you can find. For example, put a profile in Category:Madisonville, Louisiana rather than Category:Louisiana.
    Examples of Ways to Categorize a Profile:
        Place they were born, lived, married, or died, e.g. Category:Abbotsford, British Columbia.
        Cemetery in which they're buried, e.g. Category: Hollywood Cemetery, Houston, Texas.
        Religious categories or congregation in which they participated, e.g. Category: St. Francis Xavier's Church, Madisonville, Louisiana.
        Migration path or ship they sailed on, e.g. Category:Migrants from Bavaria to New York.
        School they attended, e.g. Category:Armidale High School, Armidale, New South Wales.
        Occupation, e.g. Category:Attorneys or Category:Tanners. See Alphabetical List of Occupations by Name.
        Business or industry in which they worked, e.g. Category:Jahncke Shipyard, Madisonville, Louisiana.
        Military unit, e.g. Category: 8th King's Royal Irish Hussars, battles they participated in, e.g. Category:Battle of Brandywine Creek, profession in the service, e.g., Category:B-29 Navigators, or honors received, e.g. Category:King's South Africa Medal.
        Historical event of which they were a part, e.g. Category:Antinomian Controversy or Category:Holocaust Victims at Treblinka.
        Things that make them historically significant, e.g. Category:Founders and Settlers of Rhode Island.
        Family event in which they participated, e.g. Category:Nathan Baxter and Anna Dodge 1951 Family Reunion.
        Organization in which they were involved, e.g. Category:Fellows of the Royal Geographical Society or Category:Gold Star Mothers.
        Maintenance categories for the genealogy that needs to be done on their profile, e.g. Category:Unsourced Profiles or Category:Family Brick Walls.
        Personal categories for your ongoing research or categorization that may only be of limited interest, e.g. Category: Durbin-702 Add Sources.

    
    
 {{Project Boxes}}
If the narrative is particularly long, you can include a one or two paragraph summary. This should be above the Biography heading and should not have a subheader of its own.   


    
{{Research Note Boxes}}
    Draw attention to very important information about the current state of research 
    Options Include:
    {{Conflated}} for when a profile has information on two or more people that has been combined and confused. If the conflation is so common that it may be best to leave the profile on WikiTree so that it isn't continually recreated, consider using {{Uncertain Existence}} instead. You can enter {{Conflated}} without a modifier, but it's best to enter a country, state, province or other place name. (Exs: {{Conflated|England}}, {{Conflated|Ohio|Florida}}) If you have done any work to sort out the information, explain it all in a Research Notes section.
    {{Estimated Date}} for whenever a rough estimate is used for a birth, death, and/or marriage date. Always explain how you estimated the date in a Research Notes section. {{Estimated Date}} assumes that the estimated date is a birth date. If it's a death or marriage date, or more than one date, enter one of the following:
        {{Estimated Date|Death}}, {{Estimated Date|Marriage}}, {{Estimated Date|Birth and Death}}, {{Estimated Date|Birth and Marriage}}, {{Estimated Date|Death and Marriage}}, {{Estimated Date|Birth Death and Marriage}}    
    {{Uncertain Existence}} for a person who probably never existed. Always explain the usage of {{Uncertain Existence}} in a Research Notes section. (Ex w/ delimiter: {{Uncertain Existence|New York}}) This one should go AFTER the Project Boxes    
    {{Disproven Existence}} for a profile of a person that research has shown never existed.
    {{Uncertain Family}} for when a person's position in their current family group is so uncertain that it borders on speculation, and/or when two or more of their relationships are highly uncertain. ++It's not for when just a mother, father, child (use relationship status and research notes), spouse(use Uncertain spouse), research pending(use Unsourced)
    {{Uncertain Spouse}} for when a marriage (not just a marriage date or location) is highly uncertain.
    {{Unsourced}} for a profile with no sources, or no source citations, or no source citations that clearly identify the source. You can enter {{Unsourced}} without a modifier, but it's best to enter a country, state, province or other place name. The tag places the profile in Category:Unsourced Profiles and narrower categories if a modifier is used. Narrower categories give the profile a much better chance of being found by a volunteer "Sourcerer" who can help. If you've done research but couldn't find sources please explain where you have looked in a Research Notes section. This will save other volunteers time.

{{Profile Stickers}}
    + Where a Sticker will go normally but can be anywhere in the biography section, such as near where the info being highlighted is discussed+
    Profile Stickeers used to highlight an important fact about a person or honor an important achievement. On ancestor profiles please abide by the agreed-upon style rules. No more than 5 per profile (3 is better apparently), so decide which best represent the most important things to highlight about the person's life.) Stickers can be removed by any contributor to the profile. They should not be added back without communicating with this contributor. Stickers should not be included if any contributor does not want them there (disagree kinda a d*** move).
    Go in the text section of the edit page below the Biography headline. There should be no extra hard returns above or below it, and no horizontal rules (----). They are usually grouped together but they can be spread out. They should not be placed in or below the Sources section.
    When used on members' own account profiles they can be used casually; you're encouraged to have fun with them and highlight anything you want other members and visitors to know about you.

The purpose of the text is to tell the story of your ancestor by providing more detail about the vital statistics, including explanations and information about where you got the information (Sources).
Ideas to enrich this area:
  Were they named after someone or something?
  Where did they grow up? A certain neighborhood?
  Where did they go to school? Elementary school? High school? College?
  What did they do for a living? Career path? Personal goals?
  What were their favorite subjects or interests?
  What were their hobbies?
  Are there any other web pages or Facebook pages about them?
  -For someone who recently passed away also:
  What was important to them during life?
  How did they die?
  Where are they buried?
  Were any memorial services held?
  Were any obituaries written? You may want to excerpt, upload, or link to them.
 For people who have recently passed the Memories section (beneath the About section) can be especially significant. Consider including a first-person story or fond memory about the person.
  -For ancestors also:
  How do we know what we know about them? Did someone tell us this information? Did it come from a document or website? Always include sources.
  Are there any family heirlooms that belonged to them? You might include who currently has a certain object. You might also consider creating a separate page to profile the object like a virtual "show and tell."
 If you want to go into detail about any single event in the person's life such as a wedding or military experience, a school, organization, club, family business, town where they grew up, family home, special pet that belonged to them, etc. you might start a free-space page and link to it. eg.....
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  ++Optional Subsections++
When you have a significant amount of information, you might want to break the section into subsections. These should have "level three" headlines as opposed to the "level two" headlines for the main sections. That is, they should have three equal signs around them instead of two.
=== Early Life ===
=== Family ===
Help the reader navigate WikiTree by linking to profiles of other individuals you reference in the narrative, such as parents, siblings, spouses and children.

=== Occupation ===
=== Death & Legacy ===
=== Timeline ===





== Research Notes ==
https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Help:Research_Notes
It can also be used to describe anything else you think would help a reader understand the person or that would help someone else who may be researching the same family or a family with similar characteristics
The current state of research. Where have you looked, and where haven't you looked?
To-Do list/needs/wants
What would you like to find out about them? You might include questions for your friends and family to fill in. For example, you might write "Where was Jane born? Does anyone know this? Please help!" This can go in a Research Notes section.
If you use the first-person voice in your research notes, sign and date them by entering four tildes (~~~~) (which will automatically be replaced with a link to your profile and current time once you've done a full save of the profile or page (not draft or preview) Result example: Wilson-#### 01:37, 5 September 2021 (UTC)) doesn't work in ref


=== Disputed Origins ===
Ideally, you should include a source citation for every fact included in the narrative. Be sure to note when a fact is disputed or when there is contradictory information.
Common mistakes or myths. Are there likely sources of mistakes for this person's genealogy?
What are you uncertain about? Don't be afraid to include something because you're unsure about it. For example, you might write "Jane may be buried in the Center Cemetery in Springfield. (Is this right? Great Aunt Judy said this but she wasn't sure. Can someone confirm?)"
If you use the first-person voice in your research notes, sign and date them by entering four tildes

== Acknowledgements ==
https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Help:Acknowledgements
This is always optional!!!
You can credit other genealogists in a section below the sources there are generally two reasons to do this:
  First, if the research you are adding is built on the work of someone else. For example, you may be citing primary sources such as census records but those sources may have been originally found by a family member or another genealogist and you want to give them credit for their work.
  Second, if a significant amount of work was done by a WikiTree member other than yourself and you feel that the depth and importance of their contributions may be overlooked in the changes feed.
  Acknowledgements are not formal requirements. They are optional. They are special thank-yous.
+If a contribution fits in a source citation, that's where it belongs. For example, if someone has personal direct knowledge of the fact in question, they should be cited like this: "Jane Smith and Paul Jones were married 17 June 1970 in Ithaca, New York."<ref>Personal Knowledge, [[Smith-99999|Jane Smith]].</ref>
  You don't need to acknowledge those who created duplicate profiles that were later merged. The creation, editing, and merging of duplicates is tracked just like other contributions. Look for a history item like this: X edited the data for Y (Merged Y-2 into Y-1)  Clicking "Y-2" in this example would lead you to the changes made to that profile.
  If you feel that a contributor added a lot of valuable information to a profile that was merged-away, and you think it's easy to overlook their contributions in the Changes, you may wish to give them a special mention but this should be done if you feel that the person contributed substantive, beneficial information (e.g., well-written narrative details, well-researched source citations).
