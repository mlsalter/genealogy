# Genealogy

This repository is a personal way to keep notes, profile templates, sources, and so on in a space that I can access online in a way that is organized for my brain. Also a place to keep links and copies of genealogy data and sources that I have collected for what I am researching.

1.) First area of work at the moment is making my own profile templates and notes for Wikitree.
